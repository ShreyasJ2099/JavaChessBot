# Java Chess Bot - Made by ShreyasJ2099

Made in Java using the Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms. 

Change the player1 and player2 variables to true or false depending on whether you want them to be a human player or not. Adjust the moveTime variable to how much time (in seconds) the bot has to make a move.
